# etterna-ratings-distribution
A simple web app to graph the skill rating distribution of Etterna players. There are some basic filters you can use to navigate the data, and you can also put in a players name to have them highlighted on the chart. The ratings are updated daily via GitHub Actions, and I hope to add a way to filter by "active players" in the future but no promises :)
