# etterna-ratings-distribution

A simple github pages app to graph the skill rating distribution of Etterna players. There are some basic filters you can use to navigate the data, and you can also put in a players name to have them highlighted on the chart. The ratings are updated daily via GitHub Actions, and I hope to add a way to filter by "active players" in the future but no promises :)
